[Personal Issue Tracker](https://github.com/segiddins/Life/issues)
====

General issue tracker for things that I should get around to doing.

This is so I can `/cc` people, leave notes for us, and hopefully keep track of the sort of things I'm likely to forget over time.

Feel free to make comments etc. You're also welcome to make issues.
